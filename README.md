# Getting Started

If dependencies need to be installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

in the root directory of the repository. Then, start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## What is this?
